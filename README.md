The Ansible and associated glue in this repository leverages the [Assisted Service](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service) hosted by [Redhat Cloud](https://cloud.redhat.com/) and configures the [Automated Installer](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-installer) dynamically according to the on-demand provisioned resources hosted by [Equinix Metal](https://metal.equinix.com). 

The intent behind this repository is to reduce the barrier to entry for customers of Equinix Metal to build and test Redhat OpenShift.

This repository should be considered exploratory documentation only, it should be considered as supported or production ready.
